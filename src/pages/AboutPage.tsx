        Have you ever heard the song of the cicada? It&apos;s a melody that fills the air, a
        symphony of sound that seems to come from everywhere. But did you know that there&apos;s
        more to these little insects than meets the eye?
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        Deep in the forests, where the trees grow tall and the sunlight filters through the leaves,
        there lies a secret that few have ever seen. It&apos;s said that there&apos;s a hidden tribe
        of cicadas, who gather once every hundred years to perform a mysterious ritual. They sing a
        song so powerful, so pure, that it has the power to change the course of history.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        But what is the secret of this ancient melody? Some say that it holds the key to unlocking
        the mysteries of the universe, while others believe that it&apos;s simply a way for the
        cicadas to communicate with one another. Still, others think that it&apos;s a riddle, a
        puzzle that only the wisest and most cunning can solve.
      </p>
      <p className="about__text">
        So, tell me, friend: what do you think the song of the cicada means? Is it a secret code, a
        message from the gods, or simply a beautiful melody to be enjoyed by all? The answer may be
        closer than you think...
